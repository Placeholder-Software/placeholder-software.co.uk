It&#39;s our second asset after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/70078?aid=1100lJDF&quot;&gt;Dissonance Voice Chat&lt;/a&gt; over a year ago!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wet stuff provides a powerful set of tools for making surfaces appear wet. Layered and animated decals can be used to simulate puddles, rain buildup, damp patches, leaking pipes, and more - all without making modifications to any existing texture or shaders. This allows you to dramatically change the atmosphere of a scene in seconds with simple to use tools in the editor. Or decals can be automatically generated by particle systems to accurately simulate splatters and splashes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now we&#39;re looking for testers - If this sounds like something that might be useful in your game send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto://admin@placeholder-software.co.uk&quot;&gt;admin@placeholder-software.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; and we&#39;ll get back to you with a copy to try out. &lt;img src=&quot;/images/DemoReelEndCard.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%&quot; /&gt;</content></entry></feed>
