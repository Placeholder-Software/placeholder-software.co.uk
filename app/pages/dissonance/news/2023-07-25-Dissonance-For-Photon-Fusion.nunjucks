[Photon Unity Networking](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922?aid=1100lJDF) has long held its reputation as one of Unity's most renowned networking frameworks, powering countless successful multiplayer experiences. Since its release in 2017 the [Dissonance For PUN2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/143288?aid=1100lJDF) package has consistently been one of the most popular network backends for [Dissonance Voice Chat](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/70078?aid=1100lJDF).

Today, we are excited to announce that Dissonance now has support for the new network framework: **[Photon Fusion](https://www.photonengine.com/fusion)**, available for free from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/260898?aid=1100lJDF).
