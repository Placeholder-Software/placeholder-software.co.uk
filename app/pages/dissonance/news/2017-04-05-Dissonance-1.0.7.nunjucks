<p>Dissonance has been out for nearly three months and in that time we've been working hard to release new versions with a variety of features and bugfixes. We've added support for MacOS and iOS, better latency compensation, support for dedicated servers and a variety of live inspectors. <a href="/dissonance/releases/1.0.2.html">Check </a> out <a href="/dissonance/releases/1.0.3.html">all</a> of <a href="/dissonance/releases/1.0.4.html">the</a> versions <a href="/dissonance/releases/1.0.5.html">we've</a>
released <a href="/dissonance/releases/1.0.6.html">in that time</a>.</p>

<p>With Dissonance 1.0.7 we're releasing the coolest new feature yet. We've been collaborating with <a href="http://crazyminnowstudio.com">Crazy Minnow Studio</a> to integrate Dissonance and <a href="http://crazyminnowstudio.com/unity-3d/lip-sync-salsa/">SALSA</a> to achieve real time lip synchronisation with live voice chat!</p>

To use it you'll need to make sure you have <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/16944">SALSA v1.5.0+</a> and <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/70078?aid=1100lJDF">Dissonance v1.0.6+</a>.

<p>Please note that Dissonance 1.0.7 has been submitted to the store and is awaiting approval before being available for download.
