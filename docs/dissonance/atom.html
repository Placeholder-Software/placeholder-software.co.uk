RNNoise is a noise suppression system, developed by Jean-Marc Valin, which uses machine learning to learn separate useful signal (human speech) from noise (e.g. barking dogs). RNNoise splits the audio up into 22 frequency bands, decides how noisy each band is, and then attenuates the band based on this. This process repeats again every 10 milliseconds, adjusting the volume of each frequency band to minimise noise. To find out more technical details of the algorithm see &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmvalin.ca/demo/rnnoise/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is inevitable that RNNoise &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; distort speech while reducing background sounds. However in a noisy environment this can still be an overall improvement in the quality of voice communication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RNNoise is disabled by default and can be enabled from the Dissonance &lt;a href=&quot;///Reference/Other/VoiceSettings.html&quot;&gt;settings menu&lt;/a&gt; (Window &amp;gt; Dissonance &amp;gt; Quality Settings).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you find an issue in Dissonance or want to request a new feature please report it on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance/issues&quot;&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://placeholder.software/discord&quot;&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the full release notes for this version &lt;a href=&quot;/dissonance/releases/8.0.1.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>/dissonance/news/2021-06-01-2018.4-LTS-EOL.html</id><title>Unity 2018.4 End Of Support</title><updated>2021-05-31T23:00:00.000Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="/dissonance/news/2021-06-01-2018.4-LTS-EOL.html"><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2019.4&lt;/code&gt; is now the legacy LTS version, this means the &lt;code&gt;Unity 2018.4&lt;/code&gt; is no longer supported by Unity.

Dissonance &lt;a href=&quot;///dissonance/releases/6.4.6.html&quot;&gt;6.4.6&lt;/a&gt; was the last version of Dissonance released with support for &lt;code&gt;Unity 2017.4&lt;/code&gt; - we will no longer provide support for using Dissonance on &lt;code&gt;Unity 2017.4&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Dissonance 7.0.0&lt;/code&gt; and onwards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of 2020-04-29 this means the supported Unity editor versions for Dissonance are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2018.4&lt;/code&gt; (latest LTS)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2019.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2019.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2019.3&lt;/code&gt; (latest TECH)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of bugs reported for Dissonance are due to various changes/regressions/bugs made in the TECH releases.

The TECH stream consists of three cutting edge releases a year, the LTS stream consists of the final TECH version each year with extra bugfixes. LTS versions are supported for two years after their initial release. Support for TECH versions is much shorter - only the latest TECH version is supported. Unity also offer preview versions which are not included in either of these streams (e.g. &lt;code&gt;2019.1 Alpha&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dissonance was originally developed using &lt;code&gt;Unity 5.6&lt;/code&gt; when that was the cutting edge of Unity development and since then we&amp;#39;ve supported every single version of the Unity editor released after &lt;code&gt;Unity 5.6&lt;/code&gt;. With the release of Dissonance &lt;a href=&quot;///Dissonance/Releases/6.3.0.html&quot;&gt;6.3.0&lt;/a&gt; we have decided to change our support policy to be closer to what Unity themselves support. We will support all LTS versions supported by Unity and all TECH versions &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the latest LTS. We will not support preview versions until they are promoted into the TECH stream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now that means we support:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2017.4&lt;/code&gt; (latest LTS)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2018.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2018.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2018.3&lt;/code&gt; (latest TECH)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consequently this means that Dissonance &lt;a href=&quot;///dissonance/releases/6.3.0.html&quot;&gt;6.3.0&lt;/a&gt; is the final release to be submitted to the asset store for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 5.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2017.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2017.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unity 2017.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>/dissonance/news/2018-09-26-Dissonance-6.2.5.html</id><title>Dissonance 6.2.5 Release</title><updated>2018-09-25T23:00:00.000Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="/dissonance/news/2018-09-26-Dissonance-6.2.5.html"><content>&lt;p&gt;This release brings a brand new network integration to Dissonance - using the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/webrtc-network-47846?aid=1100lJDF&quot;&gt;WebRTC Network&lt;/a&gt; Dissonance can now run completely peer to peer sessions.

This defines exactly what the three numbers in the version mean:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` - Increment MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes. - Increment MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. - Increment PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;MAJOR&lt;/code&gt; change means that a change to Dissonance might &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; your code which interfaces with Dissonance. Naturally we try to keep such changes to a minimum. When they do happen we make sure to draw attention to it in the release notes and explain how best to handle it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;/dissonance/releases/6.1.0.html&quot;&gt;Dissonance 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt; we included what we considered a very minor bugfix:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always using network order (Big endian) for network packet headers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;One number in the network protocol used &amp;quot;little endian&amp;quot; encoding instead of the more standard &amp;quot;big endian&amp;quot; encoding used on networks. We didn&amp;#39;t consider this a &lt;code&gt;MAJOR&lt;/code&gt; or even a &lt;code&gt;MINOR&lt;/code&gt; change because the network protocol is an implementation detail; your code never reads or writes packets so therefore a change to the protocol can&amp;#39;t possibly break your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, after talking to users about the consequences of this tiny change we&amp;#39;ve realised that this wasn&amp;#39;t the correct way to think about it. Although a change to the network protocol does not break any &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; it can lead to a very difficult deployment which forces end users of your application to either upgrade or be unable to communicate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have decided that in the future we will include changes to the network protocol in the version number - i.e. an incompatible change to the network will result in the &lt;code&gt;MAJOR&lt;/code&gt; version number increasing. Furthermore since an incompatible change to the network protocol is very difficult for you to deploy to your users we consider a network protocol change to be one of the worst kind of changes we can make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From this point forwards &lt;strong&gt;we don&amp;#39;t anticipate &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; needing to make an incompatible change to the protocol&lt;/strong&gt;. Upgrading to a new version of Dissonance should always be completely painless - even when you release the application to end users there will be no problems with any mix of old clients/servers in a session with new clients/servers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;update-regarding-dissonance-6-2-3&quot;&gt;Update Regarding &lt;code&gt;Dissonance 6.2.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;/dissonance/releases/6.2.3.html&quot;&gt;Dissonance 6.2.3&lt;/a&gt; we made a large improvement to the protocol:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Improved network handshake protocol to support an unlimited number of players in a Dissonance session (previously limited to approximately 20).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was the first new feature added at the network level since making the network protocol guarantee. We implemented it with both backwards and forwards compatibility in mind. This means that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if clients or server have upgraded or not, both will handle the change. In fact as long as the server has upgraded you will be able to host more than 20 clients even if none of the clients have upgraded yet!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>/dissonance/news/2018-01-26-Dissonance-After-A-Year.html</id><title>Dissonance After A Year</title><updated>2018-01-26T00:00:00.000Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="/dissonance/news/2018-01-26-Dissonance-After-A-Year.html"><content>&lt;p&gt;One year ago today Dissonance released onto the asset store after six months of development. Since then we have released &lt;b&gt;29 new versions&lt;/b&gt; with lots of exciting new features (and a lot of bugfixes too!). As this is published the 30th update, &lt;a href=&quot;/dissonance/releases/6.0.2&quot;&gt;Dissonance 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, has just been submitted to the asset store and will be available shortly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This release includes several small fixes to the acoustic echo cancellation which was introduced in Dissonance 6.0.0.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;Acoustic Echo Cancellation&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;After many months of experimentation it&#39;s finally here! Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) watches the audio coming out of the speakers and then removes that audio when it is recorded by the microphone a few milliseconds later. This prevents unbearable feedback loops, hearing your own voice sent back to you and even suppresses game sound effects from being transmitted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment AEC is &lt;b&gt;experimental&lt;/b&gt;. Quality on desktop computers has generally been excellent but it can vary with a large number of factors such as microphone quality, speaker quality, size of the room and even the amount of soft furnishing nearby! On mobile phones AEC is significantly less well tested because we only have access to a limited number of devices to test with and so it&#39;s crucial that we get feedback - if you use AEC please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&quot;&gt;contact us and tell us&lt;/a&gt; what does and does not work. &lt;h6&gt;Flexible Encoding Settings&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;In previous version of Dissonance all clients in a session used the same audio encoding settings.

Download the package below and read &lt;a href=&quot;/Basics/Quick-Start-Forge-Remastered/&quot;&gt;the tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;Channel Volume And Soft Fading&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirdly we&#39;ve added support for changing the volume of each individual channel you are broadcasting on - giving you more control over how others hear you. We&#39;ve used this to add faders to the VoiceBroadcastTrigger component - by default all voice will now fade out over 0.15 seconds instead of cutting off instantly. You can configure this and some other fader settings in the revamped inspector for the component. See more about channel volumes and the trigger fader settings &lt;a href=&quot;/Tutorials/Channel-Volume/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6&gt;Peer-to-Peer Voice Routing&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, the largest change of all is the internal changes to how Dissonance networking works - it&#39;s now possible for voice packets to be sent directly from peer to peer when the undlerying network system supports it! This can significantly reduce latency and bandwidth usage. These changes involve one very small &lt;b&gt;breaking change&lt;/b&gt; to custom network integrations which use the &lt;code&gt;BaseClient&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BaseServer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BaseCommsNetwork&lt;/code&gt;classes, the &lt;code&gt;TPeer&lt;/code&gt; generic parameter must be a &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;. Besides this the change is completely backwards compatible and will continue working with your custom networking - see the &lt;a href=&quot;/Tutorials/Custom-Networking/&quot;&gt;documentation for custom network&lt;/a&gt; implementations for more details on how to enhance your integration to enable p2p routing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the full release notes for this version &lt;a href=&quot;/dissonance/releases/3.0.0.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><id>/dissonance/news/2017-04-05-Dissonance-1.0.7.html</id><title>Dissonance 1.0.7 With SALSA Lip Sync</title><updated>2017-04-04T23:00:00.000Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="/dissonance/news/2017-04-05-Dissonance-1.0.7.html"><content>&lt;p&gt;Dissonance has been out for nearly three months and in that time we&#39;ve been working hard to release new versions with a variety of features and bugfixes.

It&#39;s flexible enough to create complex setups with multiple chat channels, positional audio playback and collider based chat rooms with no scripting required. Conversely it has a simple but powerful API available to scripts which gives you complete control over the system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#39;re incredibly excited to announce that Dissonance is finally available for sale on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/70078&quot;&gt;Unity Asset Store&lt;/a&gt; for an initial price of $45 per seat. This price includes built in support for UNet, HLAPI and Photon as well as free access to patches to add more networking systems in the future (and of course you can write your own).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is just the start. We have several upgrades already in development and planned for release in the coming months (including Mac and iOS Support).

Dissonance makes it easy to get high quality, low latency voice communication into your game no matter what network system you&#39;re using.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Work on Dissonance began back in July. We noticed that despite integrated voice communication being an essential part of a modern multiplayer game there were only *two* assets on the unity store for voice chat! Voice communication can be a hard problem to tackle, and in that short time we&#39;ve built:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Realtime audio decoding pipeline&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Multithreaded mic capture and encoding&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Custom voice activation detection filter&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Low level networking system with integrations for four other popular unity networking systems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A powerful and flexible chat room system with support for trigger volumes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Documentation, documentation, documentation!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#39;re not finished by a long way! But I&#39;m excited to say that we are approaching a point where we can release the first version of Dissonance. Within the next few weeks we&#39;ll be looking for testers who would be willing to try adding Dissonance to their multiplayer game and giving us detailed feedback on what worked and what didn&#39;t. If that sounds like you, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
