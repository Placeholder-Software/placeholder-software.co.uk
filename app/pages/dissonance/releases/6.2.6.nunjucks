With this release we've added support for the new <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922?aid=1100lJDF">PUN2</a> networking system.

## Important Note for Unity 2017.3 Users!

Due to a bug in the 2017.3 version of the Unity editor Dissonance will break all Android builds. Dissonance includes two sets of files for Android for two different CPU architectures (x86 and ARM) - the editor bug deploys _both_ of these files for ARM builds and neither of these files for x86 builds!

This issue has been fixed in Unity 2017.4 LTS, so the best fix is simply to upgrade your editor version. If you cannot do this simply go into `Assets/Plugins/Dissonance/Plugins/Android/x86` and _disable_ or _delete_ `libopus.so` and `libAudioPluginsDissonance.so`.

{% block features %}{% markdown %}
 - Added PUN2 networking integration.
 - `AudioQuality` and `FrameSize` can now be set at any time (although changed will not take place until you disconnect and reconnect).
 - Added extra monitoring on network receiver for terrible network conditions (bad enough to disrupt voice). ([#122](https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance/issues/122)).
{% endmarkdown %}{% endblock %}

{% block bugfixes %}{% markdown %}
 - Fixed all voice from a single speaker in some circumstances (most often when they have muted and unmuted themselves). ([#121](https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance/issues/121)).
 - Updated Photon BOLT integration to work with latest version of BOLT.
