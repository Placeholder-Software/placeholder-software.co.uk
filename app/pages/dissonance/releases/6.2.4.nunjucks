{% block bugfixes %}{% markdown %}
 - Rebuilt DarkRift2 plugin binaries against the latest version of DarkRift2 (`v2.2.0`)
 - Fixed an issue causing voice activated speech to frequently cut out mid sentence [#104](https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance/issues/104)
 - Fixed a data race (potentially leaving datastructure in an inconsistent state) when the audio preprocessor resets
 - Prevented audio ducking system ducking remote speakers when the local player is muted
 - Reduced the number of audio capture system resets performed when the network mode changes
 - Modified how `Forge` and `Forge Networking Remastered` integrations perform loopback (local server -> local client) to prevent potential bugs caused by buffer re-use
 - Fixed oversize playback buffer detection triggering too frequently
