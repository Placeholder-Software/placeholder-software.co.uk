This release adds two very exciting new features that have been highly requested in the last few months.

## Magic Leap Support

We've added support for the amazing [Magic Leap One](https://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-one)!

This has been a big effort involving magic leap engineers helping us develop the integration and several users of Dissonance helping test it on devices in real world applications. Huge thanks to everyone involved, this wouldn't have been possible without you.

## Mirror Networking Integration

We've added support for [Mirror Networking](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror) - a community replacement for the deprecated Unity HLAPI. Thankyou to [BigBoxVR](https://www.bigboxvr.com/) for sponsoring the development of this integration.

This has been one of the [most requested features](https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance/issues/138) in recent months. We first looked a this [back in October](https://github.com/Placeholder-Software/Dissonance/issues/124) and determined that this wasn't possible because Mirror only supported TCP, which is unsuitable for voice comms. However since then the [Ignorance UDP backend](https://github.com/SoftwareGuy/Ignorance/) for Mirror has been developed, this adds support for unreliable packets over UDP and is perfect for voice comms. **Using this integration requires the use of the Ignorance backend**.
