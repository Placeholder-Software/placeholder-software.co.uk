{% set blurb %}

<p>This release includes a new network integration for Dark Rift2 as well as some improvements to audio quality in the face of poor network conditions.</p>

<h6>DarkðŸ—²Rift 2</h6>

<p>We've added a brand new network integration bringing Dissonance to the the <a href="https://darkriftnetworking.com/DarkRift2">Dark Rift 2</a> networking system! Dark Rift 2 is a fast and highly optimised networking system which made it perfect for transmitting voice data.</p>

<p>The Dark Rift integration features a standalone (non-Unity) project for running the server. If you're trying to host Dissonance with a custom network integration and a non-Unity server this can server as a great reference to help you out.

<h6>Improved Quality In Bad Network Conditions</h6>

<p>We've added two new features to handle poor network conditions; Forward Error Correction and improved dynamic sync.</p>

<p>Forward Error Correction means that the Opus codec inserts some redundant information into every packet - if a single packet is lost the data in in can be recovered from other packets which were not lost. This can completely conceal a low rate of packet loss!<p>

<p>The dynamic sync system works to make sure that audio playback and audio capture run at roughly the same rate. We've increased the maximum rate at which it can recover from desynchronisation, this will make it possible to handle larger desyncs as well as make it return to normal faster after a desync.</p>
