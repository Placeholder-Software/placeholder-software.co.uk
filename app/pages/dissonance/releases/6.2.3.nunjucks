{% set blurb %}

<p>This release brings a number of improvements and fixes.</p>

<p>The most important change is that the Dissonance network protocol has been upgraded to support an unlimited number of players in a session (previously this was limited to around 20). This change is <i>completely backward and forward compatible</i> - old clients can talk to new servers and new clients can talk to old servers.</p>

{% block features %}
<ul>
  <li>Improved network handshake protocol to support an unlimited number of players in a Dissonance session (previously limited to approximately 20). This change is <i>backward and forward compatible</i> - any mix of old/new clients/servers will function properly.</li>
  <li>Added `ResetMicrophoneCapture` method, which will force a reset of the Dissonance microphone system. This can resolve some issue caused by third party systems interfering with the microphone</li>
</ul>
{% endblock %}

{% block bugfixes %}
<ul>
  <li>Fixed `VoiceBroadcastTrigger` component to properly fade out speech when tokens are removed</li>
  <li>Fixed `RemoteVoiceVolume` property not accepting any value except zero</li>
  <li>Fixed host migration for Photon Unity Networking integration</li>
  <li>Improved microphone reset system to do significantly less work (re-use more components)</li>
</ul>
